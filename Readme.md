# PSO2 Art

This is a repository for art that I've created using PSO2's symbol art functionality.

I provide both the conventional `.sar` file and the `.saml` file that can be used with [Symbol Art Editor Online](https://malulleybovo.github.io/SymbolArtEditorOnline/).


### What is symbol art?

Within PSO2 art can be made using provided pre-drawn primitives by moving them around and modifying their sizes and colors so that they form a particular image. You cannot simply draw on a canvas like with conventional bitmap image editing. As such, there's no decent way (as of writing) to convert a bitmap image over to symbol art without redrawing it.


### What is the difference between .sar and .saml files?

- `.sar` files are the symbol art format that is used by PSO2. These files can be directly imported into PSO2 for use.
- `.saml` files can be used with [Symbol Art Editor Online](https://malulleybovo.github.io/SymbolArtEditorOnline/) for more convenient editing (which can then be exported as `.sar` files).


### How do I import a `.sar` file?

1. Go to your Documents folder.
2. Open the `SEGA/PHANTASYSTARONLINE2_NA/symbolarts/import` folder.
3. Place the `.sar` file into the folder.
4. Open up PSO2 and log into whatever ship your character is on.
5. Go to the System menu and click on Symbol Art
6. Click on `1. Saved Lists` and change it to `4. Import`
7. Click the import button
8. Select the desired `.sar` file and assign it to a symbol art slot
9. Done. You can now use the symbol art
